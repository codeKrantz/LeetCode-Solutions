# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to **LeetCode problems**, written as part of my ongoing practice in data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is not just to store correct answers, but to:
- Explore **multiple ways to solve the same problem**
- Compare **time and space complexity** across different approaches
- Practice writing **clean, readable, and well-structured code**
- Build strong intuition for algorithmic trade-offs

Where applicable, I include:
- Alternative implementations (e.g. brute force vs optimized)
- Notes on why one approach is more efficient than another
- Complexity analysis (`O(n)`, `O(log n)`, etc.)

## Topics Covered

Problems in this repository may include, but are not limited to:
- Arrays & Strings
- Hash Maps & Sets
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Binary Search Trees
- Heaps & Priority Queues
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs
- Greedy Algorithms

## Notes

- Solutions are written for **learning and exploration**, not memorization.
- Some problems may have multiple solutions to highlight different techniques.
- Code and explanations may be updated over time as I discover better approaches.

If you're reviewing this repo: feel free to explore the different solutions and compare how efficiency and clarity evolve across problems.
